# Reverse Words in Text File

This Java program will iterate through each line in a defined text file and reverse each word retaining the original word order. 

# How it Works
1. Prepare Input: Create a file named "sample.txt" or change the file name in the source code.
2. Run the Program
```
java ReverseTextWords
```

## Notes
- The program assumes that the input file "sample.txt" exists in the same directory as the Java source code
- If "sample.txt" does not exist or cannot be accessed, the program will handle the FileNotFoundException and display an error message
